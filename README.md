This is a simple API allowing member/nonmember user to write comment on available Github Organization.

### Tech

My App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ExpressJS] - minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- [Axios] - promise based HTTP client.
- [PostgreSQL] - open source object-relational. database system
- [Winston] - logger for just about everything.
- [JSON Web Token] - open, industry standard for representing claims securely between two parties.
- [Jest] - javaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity
- [Supertest] - provides an easy-to-use API to send HTTP requests in Node.
