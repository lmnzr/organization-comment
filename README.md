# NodeJS Typescript API Example

This Is My Code Learning Project. I tried To build Typescript NodeJs API Server,

- Use Typescript to write code.
- Use Express as web app framework.
- Use CORS to enable cross-origin Requests.
- USe Helmet, secure our application by setting various HTTP headers.
- Use ESLint to standardize code.
- Use Nodemon to allow auto refresh once code edited in development.
- Use Husky to run lint-staged before git commit.
- Use Lint staged to run multiple command on staged file.

### Tech

My App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [NodeJS] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Typesript] - is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [ExpressJS] - is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- [ESLint] - is a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript.
- [Nodemon] - is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.

### Installation

The App requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) > v10 and [npm] > v6.0 to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install -d
$ npm start
```

For production environments...

### Todos

- Use Winston As Logger
- DB (Mysql/Sqlite)
- Implement OAuth Method in API Access
- Swagger Documentation
- Create Integration Test with Supertest
- Implement Test in CI
